Explain the technique you use to measure the hop distance from your machine to destination using a single probe.
	-The hop distance is done by counting each router that is visitied that is not the destination. So in my code
	 every time I visit a router, I increment the TTL by one

How you will match ICMP responses with the probes you are sending out?
	-You can send an ICMP echo request out, then listen for the response. If there is a response then it can get
	 marked, but if there is no response then that means that it was unsuccessful and would be marked failed.

(list all possible reasons you can think of for not getting the answer when probing an arbitrary host)
	-If a packets get lost in transit or there is an issue with connection the prevents conacting a host then that
	 will prevent an answer
	-Some hosts have it set to drop a packet when probed as a security measure to prevent malcious people from 
	 seeing parts of Networks and other services
